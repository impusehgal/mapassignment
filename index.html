  <p> As winter progresses, children are coping with the rapid spread of influenza, Covid-19, and Respiratory Syncitial Virus after a year of remote learning and wearing masks, according to Francisco Gonzalez, a pediatrician at Lincoln Medical Center in the Bronx. While the health impacts caused by coronavirus since the pandemic started are blatantly visible even now when kids are back in classrooms, even RSV cases are exorbitantly surmounting throughout New York City.</p>

     <p> According to RSV infections data sourced from NYC Health EpiQuery, total reported cases for RSV in NYC were 8137 in 2020. As showcased in the map above, Bronx accounted for 20.6% of reported RSV cases throughout the city and was not too far behind Queens and Brooklyn. Meanwhile, An indepth anaylysis of the EpiQuery data depicts the cases reported in different UHF code areas in the bronx. UHF area code 103, i.e, Fordham-Bronx Park had the highest number of reported cases of RSV. </p>

     <p> While these numbers on their own might not be a cause of concern for many, Gonzalez finds the findings quite worrisome. "I'm afraid that most of the patients in this data are little kids because their lungs are more vulnerable than adults," Gonzalez said. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/rsv/high-risk/infants-young-children.html"> Centers of Disease Control and Prevention </a> also caution that infants and young children are more susceptible to RSV and symptoms like runny nose, incessant coughing, low apetite and even apnea might follow once a kid is infected with the virus. "RSV is pretty mild but can cause bronchitis and respiratory issues for children under 2," says Gonzalez who also belives that those infected with RSV are also predisposed to childhood asthma. "It[RSV] is a terrifying addition to outher triggers for child asthma in the Bronx," he said.</p>

 <p> Furthermore, EpiQuery data backs up the age-dependant vulnerability that Gonzalez talks about. In 2020, children four and below had more reported RSV infections than anyother age group throughout New York City.</p>

 <p> According to Gonsalez, while shelters and households are a common breeding ground for the virus in the Bronx, kids are most likely to develop RSV infections when they come in contact with their infected peers at school. And now that they are no longer following Covid protocol of wearing masks in schools(like they were in 2020 when the most recent data was collected by the NYC Department of Health), Gonsalez predicts that the spread numbers are most likely to grow and become worse. </p>

 <p> However, it would be wrong to say that the health impications while grave, are the only issues that RSV infected kids face. Wendy Bello, a member of Community Education Council District 7 and also the secretory for Parent's Association at P.S. 001 Courtlandt in the Bronx, says that the consequences of RSV are two fold, that is, health and education both are affected because of the virus. “I feel like it affects attendance because kids can’t come in due to RSV.” Bello said. “And sometimes the opposite happens–parents don’t even reveal to the staff that their kids have RSV just so they don’t have to skip school and then other kids get infected as well.” Bello has a son who had to visit the hospital for a different illnes and she found out that he was allergic to penicillin which is vital for the body's fight against viruses. Bello said that it is important that parents realize that every child can experience the same illness differently and therefore it is imperative to take the necassary precautions to safeguard kids. According to XYC data that was originally collected from the Department of Education, attendance at PS 001 in the Bronx has fallen by almost 11 perccent from Dec 16, 2021 to Dec 16, 2022.</p>

 <p> Dr. Roberto Padilla, superintendent for school district seven, is asking families to monitor children for symptoms. His priority is to keep schools clean and have hand sanitizer available. He hopes that schools will not have to shut down again. “Families are taking this seriously and schools are taking it seriously. We have to learn to live with various viruses that come around to the point where, you know, it doesn't shut us back down.”

 <p>Lastly, Gonsalez estimates that Gonzalez estimates that 65-70% of patients at Lincoln Hospital are RSV patients. He suggests that children keep a distance from younger siblings and wash their hands if they come in contact with them. RSV does not live in the air as long as Covid-19 can. He advises taking children to the hospital if they are having trouble breathing or are not drinking water. RSV has no antiviral, but most children recover on their own with mild symptoms. Hospital treatment includes oxygen and nasal drops and suctions for babies. </p>
