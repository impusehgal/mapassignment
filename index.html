  <p>The borough of Bronx is synonymous with the name "asthma alley." Since the past many years, the number of asthma cases in kids has been visibly higher in comparison to the other boroughs of New York City. We have sourced data on asthma emergency department visits among kids aged 5-17 from the NYC EH Data Portal.According to the data, the total number of emergency visits were 63029, as observed in the time period of 2017-2019, and Bronx accounts for 36.2% (22,822) of these hospital visits. Meanwhile, Staten Insland only had 1,853 emergency visits in the three-year period-- the least out of all the five boroughs. </p>

     <p> According to <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/asthma/triggers.html"> Centers for Disease Control and Prevention </a>, excess particluate matter (PM 2.5) and an uptick in cases of rodent infestations are possible triggers for asthma among kids. Increased traffic on the Cross Bronx Expressway and expedited development of warehouses and housing units along the waterfront has had a drastic impact on the borough's air quality. The chart below analyzes the levels of particulate matter in the Bronx against the average levels in New York City over a five year period (from 2017-2021). As showcased in the data chart below, Bronx has consistently had a higher level of particulate matter in the air in comparison to the average levels observed in New York City.

     <p> "Honestly, these numbers aren't shocking at all," said Nilka Martell, referring to the data. Martell is an environmental activist and board chair of the Bronx River Alliance. Martell's son has childhood asthma which she believes is linked to pollution coming from the Cross Bronx expressway. To clean the air and create new access to greenways and parks, she is now advocating for capping of the Cross Bronx Expressway.

 <p> Besides noxious pollutants, rodent infestations are also known to cause asthma in kids. Kids who are continously in contact with rodent allergens for long periods of time (at home, for instance) are more likely to develop the disease. The 311 data shows that the number of rat complaints in the Bronx shot up to 30,500 in the beginning of 2021, the highest of all the boroughs. So far in 2022, the Bronx has racked up 23,000 rat complaints. In Brooklyn, there are 28,000; Manhattan, 13,000; Queens, 9,000; Staten Island, 2,000. </p>

 <p> Pat Marino, CEO of Rat Trap Distribution, says that "rats run rampant" in low-cost housing NYCHA complexes in the borough and their numbers have increased since covid. Marino believes that when restaurants shut down during the pandemic, rats lost their food source and migrated to the “private sector” – residential areas -- to find food. This could explain the increase in rat sightings, Marino said.
